# Data-Structure-Part-1
Welcome to the Data Structure Series. My name is Bikram Phurumbo, let me explain in three minutes how I've learned this course and how we can get the most out of it. This Data Structure Series, where we learn about linear data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables.

This series is for computer science students like me whose lecturers failed at explaining these concepts, or anyone who's preparing for a job interview. A lot of companies, especially big companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, ask data structure and algorithm questions in their interviews to see if you know how to think like a programmer.

The materials in this series will change how you think about coding. I learn how to think like a programmer and design fast and scalable algorithms. This is the first step. In this series, I'll be using Java, because that's a universally student language, but you can use any language you're familiar with, because my focus is on data structures and algorithms, not programming languages.

If you don't know Java, you can learn in any online platform they are free. If you're a C Sharp developer, you can get started immediately, because Java and C Sharp are very similar. Also, I have used IntelliJ as my IDE, which you can download from JetBrains.com, but you can use any code area you're comfortable with.

In this course, you have to solve problems. A lot of problems. And that's how I have been learning the art of problem solving. All the exercises I see in this course are popular interview questions.

These are the exercises that teach you how to think like a programmer. So every single one of them is important. Some of these exercises may be a bit challenging. Do not quickly jump to my solution. Do your best to solve the problem on your own. What matters is that you spend time thinking about various ways to solve a problem.

This process will activate certain parts of our brain, and that's what matters, not the solution. If you can't complete the exercise in a timely manner, that's perfectly fine. Don't get disappointed. We're a student, so we're learning.

If you could complete every exercise immediately, you wouldn't be taking this course, right? So here's the bottom line. This course is going to change how I think about programming. You will learn how to solve problems and write beautiful code like a professional software engineer.
